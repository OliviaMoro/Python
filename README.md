# Python Repository
Contains codes written in python. Most of them are written from algorithm available to anyone. Some of them are solutions of exercises from "Méthodes numériques appliquées pour le scientifique et l'ingérieur", Jean-Phillipe Grivet, EDP sciences, 2013. 

## derivation
There are a few algorithms to compute function derivatives. 

## functionApproximation
Most of the programs implements methods to approximates functions used in physics or not. 

## functionPlot
Methods used to plot charts such as :
* 2D curves with one or more datasets
* 3D surface plot


## integration
Computes the integral of a function between two boundaries : $\int_{a}^{b}f(t)dt$.


## integrator
Includes numerical integration algoritms as well as examples. Methods contains :
* Euler method
* Runge-Kutta's
* velocity verlet

## interpolation
Can interpolates from set of points (x,f(x)) a functions by a polynomial :
* the well known Lagrange method
* Bezier curves

## zeros
Usefull for finding solutions of equations such as f(x) = 0 or a system of non linear equation f(x,y) = 0 and g(x,y) = 0.
